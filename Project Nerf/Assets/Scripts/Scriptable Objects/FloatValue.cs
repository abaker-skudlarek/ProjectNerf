/**
 *  @file FloatValue.cs
 *
 *  @brief This file is going to be inherited from ScriptableObject (explained below).
 *          It will be used to transfer values between scenes and give me an easy
 *          way to assign things like HP to many object at once. For example,
 *          I can create a float value for all 3 HP enemies and attach it to every enemy
 *          that I want to have 3 HP.

/* This class is inheriting from ScriptableObject, which means that this script

 *  the scene, which means that we can assign values to it that can be read
 *  through MULTIPLE scenes, instead of being tied to just one. This will not
 *  be reset when the scene is reloaded. ScriptableObjects don't get start
 *  or update functions. */
